# Arduino - Room temperature

First Arduino project

My parents house temperature wildly fluctuates. This is the code for seeting up
an arduino with a light to show the room temperature. It uses a temperature sensor
and an RGB LED to show the rooms temperature.

- Lights up red if over 25 degrees c
- Lights up blue if it's below 20 degrees c
- Lights up green if it's between 20 - 25 degrees c
